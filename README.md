# Vehicle-and-Pedistrian-detection


This application is able to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians on camera for autonomous cars and/or in cases of provided video files using open computer vision. The different Vehicles that this application is able to detect are : Car, Bus, CNG (a prominent vehicle in Bangladesh), Bike and Two-wheelers along with the pedestrians of course. The underlying algorithm used in order to create the classifier is “Haar cascade algorithm”. We select OpenCV as the development tool for the implementation of vehicles and pedestrian detection in a video segment. This application is developed in Python using OpenCV 4.6.0

### Datasets : 

Around 1000+ Bangladeshi local vehicle image datasets were used to train the cascade classifier.
The dataset is available at: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pwyyg8zmk5/2
